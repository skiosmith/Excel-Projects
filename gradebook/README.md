# Gradebook Project

This is the Gradebook project. In this project:

- The **orientation function** was used to rotate text in header columns.
- **Absolute cell referencing** was applied for consistent formula replication.
- **Conditional Formatting** highlighted:
  - High- and low-performing employees (using Highlight Cell Rules).
  - Performance icons (using Icon Sets).
- The **OR statement** flagged employees for possible termination based on test results.
- **Charts** were created to visualize performance across tests.
