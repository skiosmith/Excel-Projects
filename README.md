# Excel Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Excel Projects Portfolio — a curated collection of practical projects built in Microsoft Excel. These projects highlight my skills in advanced spreadsheet design, formula logic, data visualization, and automation using Excel's built-in features.

Each folder contains a real-world scenario, ranging from payroll calculations to performance grading systems. These projects apply key Excel functions like conditional logic, absolute referencing, and data visualization to solve tasks efficiently and accurately.
