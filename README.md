# Excel Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Excel Projects Portfolio — a curated collection of practical projects built in Microsoft Excel. These projects demonstrate my ability to use Excel for data analysis, automation, and business problem-solving.

Each folder contains a real-world scenario, ranging from payroll calculations to performance grading systems. These projects apply key Excel functions like conditional logic, absolute referencing, and data visualization to solve tasks efficiently and accurately.
